The BitCurator environment includes a set of custom scripts to assist with 
simple data analysis and triage tasks when navigating files on the Desktop.
These scripts can be executed by right-clicking on any regular file, selecting
"Scripts" from the context menu, and navigating to the submenu associated
with the desired script.
